"""Fetch feed bytes from owner-approved addresses; the only place Signal uses the network.

Built on ``netpin``: its public-address rule (``netpin.is_public``, which also refuses the NAT64,
IPv4-compatible, 6to4 and ISATAP forms), its pinned TLS connection and its deadline-bounded
socket. This module adds the address rules for feeds (below), conditional requests, 304 and the
feed ``Accept`` value.

Rules:
- https only; the host must be a plain DNS name (no IP literal, userinfo, percent escape or
  non-ASCII) and the port is not 0. The host is resolved once per hop; every address it
  resolves to must be public (``netpin.is_public``: an answer that is not exact text is not).
- The connection goes to the first checked address, with the certificate verified for the host
  name. Nothing looks the name up again, so a host that changes its answer after the check
  cannot change where the request goes.
- Redirects (301, 302, 303, 307, 308) are followed by this module's own loop, at most
  MAX_REDIRECTS in all, never through a proxy. A target must be https, a plain host name and
  the default port; each hop is resolved, checked and pinned like the first. A redirect
  response's body is not read, and the conditional headers go to the first address only.
- The response is closed as well as the connection on every path, a refusal mid-body included.
- 10 seconds per socket operation (TIMEOUT_SECONDS); one TOTAL_SECONDS deadline for the whole
  fetch, every hop, headers and body included, spent once the clock reaches it; a 2 MB body cap;
  a body shorter than its
  declared Content-Length, and any Content-Encoding other than identity, are refused.

Known ceiling: the one system DNS lookup per hop cannot be interrupted by the standard library.
A lookup that hangs ends only at the resolver's own timeout, after which the deadline is checked
and no connection is opened once it has passed.
